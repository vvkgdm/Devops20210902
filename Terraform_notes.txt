normally to write Terraform,Industry best practice to write the code in 3 files

3. variable.tf


In Main.tf
provider --->cloud provider

Below 
resource ---> service in the cloud
ami--> ami Id
instance type ---> configuration of instance
tags --> name

resource "aws_instance" "test1"{
ami ="ami-06a0b4e3b7eb7a300"

}
}
