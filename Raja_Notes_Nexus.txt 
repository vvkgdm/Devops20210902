Creating a Repository in Nexus:
For Maven 3 types of repo are there group[multiple repos],proxy[Created in another server and placed in this nexus],hosted[In the nexus server]

We create two type of repo's 1 for the snapshots
                             1 fot the Releases
We need to make maven to connect to nexus to the remote repository so that mvn dont need to conect public repo directly. It will connect to public via nexus
For that we need to create repository group add the repositories in the settings {via UI} maven central maven public and other so that maven can connect to repositories via nexus not directly.
